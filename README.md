### Perform hypothesis testing using COVID-19 Indonesia dataset

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hendratno/covid19-indonesia

We will test whether the mean of total cases of DKI Jakarta, Jawa Timur, and Sumatera Selatan are significantly different or not.
It seems that they are significantly different since `DKI Jakarta` average is `587520` case per day and the rest is between half of DKI Jakarta `38019` for `Sumatera Selatan` and `263062` for `Jawa Timur`.

**Since the p-value is below 0.05, then we reject the Null Hypothesis.** We conclude that the difference of DKI Jakarta, Jawa Timur, and Sumatera Selatan is statistically significant.
